# Image-processing-
Basic Image processing using MATLAB
1. Find number of rows and columns of image and find the data for the pixel in the fifth row 
and second column. 
2. Write the program that produces mirror image of the image and display both the original 
and mirror images.
3. Write a MATLAB code that will do the following
a) Read any gray scale image.
b) Display that image.
c) Again display the image such that the pixels having intensity values below 50 will
display as black and pixels having intensity values above than 150 will display as 
white. And the pixels between these will display as it is.
4. Read an image and reduce the resolution of image by four. Display both the original and new 
image with original size.
5. Read an image and reduce the quantization level to 64 and16 gray levels and display result in 
same window.
6. Take two images and perform following operations and display:
a) Add two images 
b) Find absolute difference of two images
c) Divide two images
d) Subtract two images
e) Add the images using linear combinations. Specify the output as type uint16 to avoid 
truncating the result.
f) Find complement of images and add.
g) Multiply any image by itself.
h) Comment on the results observed.
 Comment on the results observed.
 7. Perform the following on test images of Lena, Barbara, Cameraman and Goldhill 
a) Zooming by a factor of 2 and 3 using nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear 
interpolation and bicubic interpolation methods and 
b) Shrinking by a factor of 2 and 3 
 Comment on the results observed.
 8. Perform the following enhancement techniques on test images 
 a) Contrast stretching using a piece wise linear function
 b) Histogram stretching 
 c) Histogram equalization
 Comment on the results observed.
9. Perform image smoothing using averaging and median filter. Use an image with salt and pepper 
noise and a mask of size 5x5. Comment on the results observed.
10. Perform highpass filtering using first and second order derivatives on 3 types of images (Low in 
details, mid detailing and high on details.)
